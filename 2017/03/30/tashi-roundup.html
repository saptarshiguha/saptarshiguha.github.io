<p>It’s been nearly 3 weeks since Mum and Dad went to Jijo and Debarchana’s
place. I’m sure they are having a relaxing time in the spacious house surrounded
by trees and rolling back yards (but no Tashi!). In those three weeks, I spent
two weeks along with Tashi, two days in Vancouver and now back to work. Sheetal
takes her turn to stay at home (on leave, though with pressure from work it
doesn’t always look like that).</p>

<p>And these three weeks have been satisfying and tiring. My schedule ran like
clockwork: wake up, play (which included the always funny holding his hands,
crying ‘1-2-3-blast-offf’ and he would sit up and then stand. Never fails to
bring smiles to his face). Some play pen time and some swing time. After three
months, he happily sits in his baby bjorn rocker (given by Nams) while i cook
and eat my breakfast. I realize now that the first three months are really about
body stabilization. If I would tell someone having a baby, for the first three
months, just hold your baby, enjoy the few smiles, the grins, but don’t expect
much. She might not enjoy your book time, or your rockers, or your fancy new
toys, but come the 4-6 month time period, most babies come right on track and
will engage with you in so many ways: staring at your face, tracing your
moustache, watching your every morsel (he looks longingly at everything we eat
and at around the 5 and half month mark we’ve been giving avocado and banana. In
the next few days we’ll introduce, according to the new health recommendations,
peanuts , soy and cashews since exposing the baby early to allergens apparently
reduces the chance of allergic responses. He puts his tiny fists into the
avocado mix and squishes it through his fist. I think he is going to be a messy
eater. And grin his way out of being scolded).</p>

<p>So, while awake, he doesn’t cry much. Mostly when hungry or sleepy. A relief
that he can engage with himself and plays in his cot (for 20 minutes or so),
learning that some of his toys are motion controlled and tossing them produces a
sound, that some if banged against his knee also make a sound. I keep him away
from plants, since he grabs the leaves with his paws and tears them straight and
is his grip strong! I showed him how to press the sanitizer dispenser but
alas his he doesn’t have enough strength/coordination to press down on the
dispenser: his motions are limited to banging, not controlled
pressing. Interestingly when we read a book (and now after 3.5 months, we can
happily get through a book), he bangs on every page. My interpretation is that
his banging is many different intents expressed as one action. In this case
banging could be to touch and feel pictures and turning pages. When he’s fed and
rested, i throw him in the air, his hands flung out (reflex), for a second he is
suspended in mid air, his eyes lit, his smile intense, i throw him up and down,
but only a few times. I don’t want him to get bored of it. I don’t want his
smiles to take flight.</p>

<p>Tashi seems to not care for pacifiers anymore. This is a good and bad thing: we
can’t use it to calm him when he cries/yells but at the same time it’s one less
dependency)</p>

<p>He now smiles at the mirror. A few days back, we were looking at the mirror and
he turned from the mirror to look up at me and then back at the mirror. His
eyes saying “Are the two images the same?”, I laughed and nodded my head
vigorously, Yes!. I like to think from then on he smiles at the mirror. Such
self love.</p>

<p>Feeding him is another highlight of the day. He likes his milk warm and now
promptly grabs the bottle with both hands and requires little support from me. I
prefer the Latch brand of bottles since the nipple moves around with his always
moving head. Sometimes he forgets he needs to hold the bottle up as the milk
finishes, but then that’s i’m there for, no? Happily fed, he blows bubbles and
grabs his tiny feet and rocks with satisfied pleasure.</p>

<p>My routine, as I said above, is mostly clockwork. His wake spans 2 hours
long. So wake up, then play and then nap, followed by food (typically 5 oz, 3
easily, rest and then 2), then play, nap and then food again.</p>

<p>Our afternoons would be a nice walk in the baby bjorn carrier and he so loves
going to the park nearby (Ninos Unidos at 23rd and Folsom). The weather is
gorgeous and at that time, the sun is lower, the light is golden, the air filled
with children running, laughing,screaming, parents laughing, the tinkling bell
of the ice cream man. Tashi watches everything around him, his eyes drinking
everything in. It’s immensely calming for me too.</p>

<p>The only problem we had were his sleep. During the day, it’s easy to get Tashi
to fall asleep on my person, but to lay him down was an art in
timing. Invariably he would wake up. Typically nap lengths were 50 minutes. And
he would take 2 naps and a short nap in the evening.</p>

<p>The night sleep was the most erratic and fitful for us too. Never sure when he
would sleep, we would look for cues, start pacing or rocking . My technique was
to rock him, listen to his wails for 5 minutes, then put him down after bouncing
him to sleep. This invariably worked, and he would sleep for a few hours and
then wake and we would feed. This would go throughout the night and he would be
always feeding/rocking him. His nighttime was becoming a tiring dreadful
mess. And things came to a head when I came back from Toronto to find he would
wake up as soon as i put him down!</p>

<p>So i gave in and decided to try the Ferber approach. I will write my thoughts on
this in a few days when i’ve confirmed it works.</p>

<p>All i can say is that yesterday, he bathed (bathing has become single person
routine which is the second highlight of the day. He <em>loves</em> splashing in the
water, while I scrub him down. And then dry and give him a loving oil massage
while he grins throughout)., had avocado, 7.5 oz of milk!!!, was shushed to
drowsy , put down, cried 17 mins and slept <em>11 hours</em> straight.</p>

<p>Next week Tashi starts going to daycare for 3 hours a day. He changes so much
and his learning new things, I’m scared of missing out. Everyone around me say
they grow so fast and to save every moment. I know what they mean.</p>

<p>New days ahead?</p>
